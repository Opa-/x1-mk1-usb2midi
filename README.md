Native Instruments discontinued the support for the Traktor Kontrol X1 MK1 since MacOS Catalina [see here](https://support.native-instruments.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014900358-Compatibility-of-Native-Instruments-Products-on-macOS). This means that the controller is not recognized by MacOS nor Traktor anymore and it's not possible to use it as a MIDI controller because Native Instruments doesn't want to develop a proper driver.

Note that a nicer way of doing this would be to develop a real driver. But in order to use Apple's [DriverKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/driverkit), you need to enroll for Apple Developer Program for $99 a year. 

This program aims to :poop: on NI's planned obsolescence and expensive Apple Dev Program by providing a way to use the X1 MK1 as a MIDI controller with the software of your choice.

Thanks to @joherold repository for all the findings [joherold/traktor_x1](https://github.com/joherold/traktor_x1)

> Disclaimer: This is my first Rust program, use at your own risks :)

So far, it has been tested with 2 X1 MK1 against Traktor Pro 3.11.0 44 on a Apple M2 Pro running MacOS Ventura 13.6.4 (22G513).

## Install (macOS)

Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/Opa-/x1-mk1-usb2midi/releases/latest) and run the App, it should launch in the Dock and you should have an icon in the menu bar as well, listing all currently connected X1 Mk1.

> The first time you run the app, macOS will not run it, saying it's from an unidentified developer. You need to go in System Settings > Privacy & Security, scroll down and click "Open Anyway".

A basic mapping is also available on the release page `DeckAB.tsi`. You can import it into Traktor (created with Traktor 3, not sure about Traktor 2 compatibility). The application creates virtual MIDI ports using the serial number of the controller as the name so you should put it as both `Input` and `Output` like this :

If you need additional controller, just duplicate the device, assign the `In-Port` & `Out-Port` to the other X1 Mk1 serial number and click on `Edit` -> `AB > CD` to convert the mapping :

If you want to do your own mapping, you can simply use the "Learn" feature of Traktor and click on the buttons ðŸ˜‰
